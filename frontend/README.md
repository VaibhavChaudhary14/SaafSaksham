**SaafSaksham** is a **gamified civic-tech SaaS platform** that transforms cleanliness and waste-management actions into **verified, measurable, and rewardable impact** using AI, community validation, and incentive economics.

---

## Why SaafSaksham?

Urban cleanliness fails not due to lack of effort, but due to lack of **visibility, verification, and motivation**.

SaafSaksham introduces a system where:

* Actions are **tracked**
* Impact is **verified**
* Contributors are **rewarded**
* Cities receive **real-time data**
* Corporates fund **measurable CSR outcomes**

---

## Core Principles

* **Action-Driven:** Focuses on *doing*, not just reporting.
* **Verification-First:** AI + community trust ensure authenticity.
* **Incentive-Aligned:** Rewards real work, not noise.
* **Inclusive by Design:** Citizens, municipal workers, and informal waste collectors all participate.
* **Data-Native:** Every action generates usable civic intelligence.

---

## How It Works

1. **Perform a Cleanliness Task**
   Clean, collect, segregate, or maintain a public space.

2. **Submit Proof**
   Geo-tagged before/after images or videos.

3. **Verify Impact**
   AI validation + nearby community confirmation.

4. **Earn Rewards**
   Digital credits redeemable as cash, perks, or CSR/carbon impact units.
